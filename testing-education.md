# Testing Education

What follows is a bunch of resources I've found useful when learning how to do testing better. There's no particular order to these resources, so feel free to pick whatever you feel like studying. This list is by no means complete, but it will be updated as I find or remember more. Feel free to let me know if you feel like I should include something that's not here.
